# Gmail-integration
this project is a ready to use gmail integration using Flask framework , you will be able to integrate most important gmail services in your app, if you use other technologies other than Flask just put this project in a microservice and you are ready to go .


the first thing you need to do is to create a developer account in google \n
then you need to create  a  gmail api client and download the credentials then put it in your project in order to make the integration work properly \n
you need also to have mysql server installed in your pc/server and replace mysql server credentials with yout own creds \n
the last thing you need to do is to run create_db.py before you run the app for the first time in order to crete the database \n
ps: don't wory you will need this database in other integrations that we will publish soon \n
